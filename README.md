 We plan to use the attrition data to look at different factors and how they correlate to attrition, such as : age, distance from home, gender,
  business travel etc. We will start with some scatterplots and linear regression. We may use some bar charts with bins as well to look for patterns and trends.
  business travel etc. We first dropped columns from the dataset that were not statistically relevant, and decided to use pie charts to show the percentage of those who attrited and those who did not.  Next we displayed relevant columns together by taking the mean value of each and comparing between those who kept with those who left in a unstacked bar graph.

  Finally, we wanted to confirm our findings by making t-tests of columns we found a noticeable difference in the means for.
